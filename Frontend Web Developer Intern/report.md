Report: Transforming Wireframe into Static Web Page

Project Title: Transforming Wireframes into Static Web Pages
Intern Name: Unnati Karayat
Brand Name: Unkaris

1. Design Decisions

The layout was structured using semantic HTML tags for clarity and accessibility. The color palette used shades of blue to reflect professionalism and creativity. Flexbox was chosen for layout alignment, ensuring consistent spacing and visual balance.

2. Layout Strategy

The design follows a top-down structure:

Header with navigation

Hero section for the main message

Content section (features)

Footer with credits
Responsive design principles were applied using CSS media queries for mobile and tablet optimization.

3. Challenges and Solutions

Challenge: Aligning elements precisely as per the wireframe.
Solution: Used CSS Flexbox and consistent padding/margin.

Challenge: Maintaining responsiveness across screens.
Solution: Added breakpoints using @media queries and tested with Chrome dev tools.

Challenge: Choosing fonts and colors that match the wireframe.
Solution: Used web-safe fonts and referenced design palette from the concept.

4. Testing and Validation

The page was tested on Chrome, Edge, and mobile viewport simulators.
No HTML or CSS validation errors were found using W3C validators.

5. Conclusion

This task helped strengthen my understanding of semantic HTML, CSS layout design, and responsive web principles. The final static page closely resembles the wireframe, demonstrating accuracy, design consistency, and adaptability.
