Enhancing Web Page Performance and Accessibility

The objective of this task was to optimize a static webpage for better performance and accessibility. The optimization process included improving page speed, semantic structure, and usability for users with disabilities. To enhance performance, unnecessary CSS rules were removed, selectors were simplified, and images were optimized using compressed formats and lazy loading. CSS and HTML were minified to reduce file size and improve loading time. For accessibility, semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <main>, and <footer> were implemented, along with ARIA attributes and proper label associations for form controls. Each image includes descriptive alt text to support screen readers. The page ensures clear heading hierarchy, sufficient color contrast, and full keyboard navigability for users with motor impairments. Tools like Google Lighthouse and WAVE Accessibility Checker were used to evaluate improvements in accessibility and load performance. As a result, the webpage is faster, cleaner, and inclusive to a wide range of users. This project demonstrates practical implementation of modern web optimization techniques and accessibility standards, ensuring that the web content is not only visually appealing but also efficient, user-friendly, and compliant with WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
