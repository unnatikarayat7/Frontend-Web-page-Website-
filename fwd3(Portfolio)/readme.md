Objective:

To enhance user interaction on a static webpage through JavaScript functionalities such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and animations.

Interactive Features Implemented:

Dark/Light Mode Toggle:
Enables users to switch between themes dynamically. Implemented using classList.toggle() on the body element.

Dynamic Project Details Display:
A “Show/Hide Details” button reveals or hides extra project information, improving content interaction.

Form Validation:
Ensures all input fields are filled before form submission. Prevents empty submissions and provides instant feedback.

Scroll-to-Top Button:
Appears when the user scrolls down, enabling smooth page navigation using window.scrollTo() with smooth behavior.

Key JavaScript Concepts Used:

Event Listeners (addEventListener)

DOM Manipulation (getElementById, classList.toggle, textContent)

Conditional Logic and Form Validation

Scroll Event Handling and Animations

Challenges Faced:

Managing smooth transitions between dark and light modes.

Preventing form reload on submission using e.preventDefault().

Ensuring all interactive elements remain responsive on smaller screens.
